# AllStarControl

An iOS app to make iON All Star Guitar become an iOS virtual MIDI controller.

You will need the iON All-Star Guitar hardware to use with the app.

Launch a virtual MIDI instrument/synth app first, then use AllStarControl with the hardware to play the synth!

The usage can be found on my YouTube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3hfTTBl5Uk8Q3QMYyy_EdHVTSr1cEF8U
